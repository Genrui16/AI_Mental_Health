# AI Mental Health Mood Tracker App

This repository is now a Swift Package. You can open it directly in Xcode and run the app.

## Running in Xcode
1. Open Xcode and choose **File > Open**.
2. Select the `Package.swift` file in the root of this repository.
3. After the package loads, choose the *MoodTrackerApp* scheme and run (\u2318R) on an iOS simulator or device.

The package uses an `@main` SwiftUI `App` structure so no additional project files are required.

## Command line
You can also attempt to build with Swift Package Manager:

```bash
swift build
```

(Compilation requires macOS/iOS SDKs; it will not build on Linux.)
